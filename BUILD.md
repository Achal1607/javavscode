<!-- This file has been modified for Oracle Java SE extension -->

## Prerequisities

- JDK, version 17 or later
- Ant, latest version
- Maven, latest version
- Node.js, latest LTS (to build VSIX)

## Fetching and building the code

```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/oracle/javavscode.git
$ cd javavscode
# the following target requires git executable to be on PATH:
$ ant apply-patches
$ ant build-netbeans

# Note if you do not wish to have l10n in scope then add no-l10n before any ant invocation target at beginning as below, by default l10n is enabled
$ ant no-l10n apply-patches
$ ant no-l10n build-netbeans
```


## Building VS Code extension

To build the VS Code extension invoke:

```bash
ant build-vscode-ext
```
The resulting extension is then in the `build` directory, with the `.vsix` extension.
The typical file name is `oracle-java-0.1.0.vsix`.

### Building for Development

If you're developing the extension, follow these steps to build the project for faster iterations without packaging a `.vsix` file:

1. Run the following command to build the Language Server Protocol (LSP) server:
   ```bash
   $ ant build-lsp-server
   ```
2. Navigate to the `vscode` folder:
   ```bash
   $ cd vscode
   ```
3. Install the necessary Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```
4. Start the build watcher to automatically rebuild the extension on file changes:
   ```bash
   $ npm run watch
   ```

This process is faster than packaging the extension as a `.vsix` file, allowing for quicker development cycles.

### Debugging the Extension

Follow these steps to debug both the extension's TypeScript code and the NetBeans server code:

#### 1. Debugging TypeScript Code (VS Code Extension)
1. Open the `vscode` folder in VS Code.
2. Press `F5` to launch and debug the extension.

#### 2. Debugging NetBeans Code (Server Side)
1. Open the **Command Palette** using `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Search for **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)** and select it.
3. Locate or add the `jdk.serverVmOptions` setting in the JSON file and append the following arguments:
   ```json
   "jdk.serverVmOptions": [
      "-Xdebug",
      "-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,suspend=y,address=8000"
   ]
   ```
4. Start your debugging session. The NetBeans server will suspend execution and wait for a remote debugger to connect at port `8000`.

[NOTE: If you are using multiple profiles in VS Code, then set above configuration in appropriate profile

This configuration will enable you to debug both the extensionâ€™s TypeScript code and the NetBeans server-side code.

#### To enable Netbeans logs in the output channel of VS Code IDE

##### Option 1: Enable `jdk.verbose` Logging
1. Open the **Command Palette** using `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Search for **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)** and select it.
3. In the settings JSON file, add or update the following setting:
   ```json
   "jdk.verbose": true
   ```

##### Option 2: Enable NetBeans Logs via JVM Options
1. Open the **Command Palette** using `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS).
2. Search for **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)** and select it.
3. Locate or add the `jdk.serverVmOptions` setting and append the following argument to the array:
   ```json
   "jdk.serverVmOptions": ["-J-Dnetbeans.logger.console=true"]
   ```
4. For further debugging you can set Log Level to FINEST by appending following argument to the array:
   ```json
   "jdk.serverVmOptions": ["-J-Dnetbeans.logger.console=true", "-J-Dorg.netbeans.modules.java.lsp.server.lsptrace.level=FINEST"]
   ```

Both options will enable logging from the NetBeans server in the VS Code Output Channel.

### Cleaning the Extension

Often it is also important to properly clean everything. Use:

```bash
$ ant clean-vscode-ext
$ cd netbeans/
$ ant clean
```

### Testing the Extension

The `java.lsp.server` module has classical (as other NetBeans modules) tests.
The most important one is [ServerTest](https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/java/java.lsp.server/test/unit/src/org/netbeans/modules/java/lsp/server/protocol/ServerTest.java)
which simulates LSP communication and checks expected replies. In addition to
that there are VS Code integration tests - those launch VS Code with the
VS extension and check behavior of the TypeScript integration code:

```bash
$ ant build-vscode-ext # first and then
$ ant test-vscode-ext
```

In case you are behind a proxy, you may want to run the tests with

```bash
$ npm_config_https_proxy=http://your.proxy.com:port ant test-vscode-ext
```

when executing the tests for the first time. That shall overcome the proxy
and download an instance of `code` to execute the tests with.

## Working with git submodules

This project uses [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) . In particular netbeans and netbeans-l10n are submodules pointing to specific commits in their respective repositories .

### Switching Branches 

Add the --recurse-submodules  flag to the git checkout command to update the submodules during the checkout.
```bash
git checkout --recurse-submodules <branch_name>
```
Note:- Merging branches with submodules pointing to different commits can be tricky. Refer the [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) for more details on the same.

### Changing submodules versions 

```bash
# Fetching changes from remote submodule repositories 
git submodule update --remote   
# Changing the submodule version
cd netbeans
git checkout <commit_hash>
cd ..
# Committing the submodule version 
git add netbeans
git commit -m "Updated netbeans"
```
